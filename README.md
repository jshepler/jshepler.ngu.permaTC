# jshepler.ngu.permaTC (beta)

A mod for NGU Idle that adds a permanent Troll Challenge. Every 2 minutes you get a troll (every 5th a big troll), just like in the challenge.

However, since this isn't an actual challenge, you can run the regular challenges. You will get the permaTC trolls ON TOP OF the challenge you're running. Yes, this means in the regular troll challenge, you will be getting twice as many trolls! Even worse, duing the NORB challenge, you will be getting trolls where the big trolls do things that remain in effect until you rebirth - which you can't do!

**This mod cannot be used with the [mod pack](https://github.com/jshepler/jshepler.ngu.mods)**. Currently, this mod conflicts with the pack and so won't be loaded. I will eventually add permaTC to the pack.**

# Installation

If you already have bepinex installed, then you only need to download the `jshepler.ngu.permaTC.dll` from the [latest release](https://github.com/jshepler/jshepler.ngu.permaTC/releases/latest).

If not, follow the install directions for the [mod pack](https://github.com/jshepler/jshepler.ngu.mods), but instead of downloading the `jshepler.ngu.mods.dll` file, download the `jshepler.ngu.permaTC.dll` from the [latest release](https://github.com/jshepler/jshepler.ngu.permaTC/releases/latest).
